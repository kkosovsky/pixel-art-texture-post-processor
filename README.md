## Features

‚ú® **Automatic Import Configuration** - No more manual texture import settings  
üéØ **Pixel-Perfect Rendering** - Point filtering and uncompressed textures by default  
üìè **Smart Texture Sizing** - Automatically sets max texture size to nearest power of two  
üé® **Configurable PPU** - Set pixels-per-unit globally across your sprites  
üìÇ **Path-Based Rules** - Include/exclude specific paths from processing  
üî≤ **Sprite Mesh Control** - Configure FullRect vs Tight mesh based on naming or paths  
üé¨ **Sprite Mode Detection** - Automatically set Single vs Multiple mode for animation sheets  
‚öôÔ∏è **Zero Manual Work** - Once configured, all new sprites are processed automatically

## Installation

### Via Git URL (Unity Package Manager)

1. Open Unity Package Manager (`Window > Package Manager`)
2. Click the `+` button ‚Üí `Add package from git URL`
3. Enter: `https://github.com/kkosovsky/pixel-art-texture-post-processor.git`

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract to your project (recommended: `Assets/PixelArtTexturePostProcessor/` or `Packages/`)
3. Unity will automatically detect and import the package

## Quick Start

1. The package auto-creates default settings if none exist
2. Navigate to settings: `Assets > PixelArtTexturePostProcessor > Editor > Settings > Assets > PAT_DefaultSettings`
3. Configure your settings (PPU, paths, etc.)
4. Settings are automatically active if it's the only one or first found
5. Import your pixel art - settings apply automatically!

## Configuration

### Settings Location

Default settings are stored at:
```
Assets/PixelArtTexturePostProcessor/Editor/Settings/Assets/PAT_DefaultSettings.asset
```

You can also create custom settings via:  
`Right-click in Project ‚Üí Create > PixelArtPostProcessor > Settings`

### Working with Multiple Settings

You can create multiple settings configurations for different workflows:

1. Create new settings: `Right-click ‚Üí Create > PixelArtPostProcessor > Settings`
2. Configure the settings as needed
3. Click the **"Set Active"** button in the Inspector to activate those settings
4. Only one settings object can be active at a time (others are automatically deactivated)

**Active Settings Indicator:**
- Active settings show: "This settings object is currently ACTIVE" (blue info box)
- Inactive settings show: "This settings object is currently INACTIVE" (yellow warning box)

**Loading Priority on Startup:**
1. Settings marked as `isActive = true` (uses first if multiple found)
2. First available settings file (auto-activated as fallback)
3. Creates default settings if none exist

### Base Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **PPU** | 32 | Pixels Per Unit for all sprites |
| **Min Texture Size** | 32 | Minimum texture size (power of two) |
| **Is Readable** | true | Enable/disable Read/Write on textures |
| **Post Process Order** | 0 | Execution order relative to other postprocessors |

### Path Configuration

**Include Paths**  
Array of paths to process (e.g., `Assets/Sprites/`)

**Exclude Paths**  
Default: `["Packages/", "Assets/Gizmos/", "Assets/StreamingAssets/"]`  
Array of paths to skip even if in include paths

> **Note:** Only textures in `includePaths` AND not in `excludePaths` will be processed. By default, Unity packages, editor gizmos, and streaming assets are excluded to prevent unintended processing.

### Sprite Mesh Type

Control whether sprites use `FullRect` or `Tight` mesh generation:

**Full Rect Mesh Substrings**  
Default: `["9Slice"]`  
Any texture path containing these strings uses FullRect mesh

**Full Rect Mesh Paths**  
Specific paths that should use FullRect mesh

> Textures not matching these rules use `Tight` mesh type.

### Sprite Mode

Control whether sprites are imported as `Single` or `Multiple`:

**Multiple Sprite Mode Substrings**  
Default: `["Animation"]`  
Any texture path containing these strings uses Multiple sprite mode (for sprite sheets)

**Multiple Sprite Mode Paths**  
Specific paths that should use Multiple sprite mode

> Textures not matching these rules use `Single` sprite mode.

## What Gets Applied

When a texture is processed, the following settings are automatically configured:

```csharp
// Texture Settings
textureCompression = Uncompressed
filterMode = Point
maxTextureSize = NearestPowerOfTwo(actualSize)
isReadable = [from settings]
spritePixelsPerUnit = [from settings]

// Sprite Settings
spriteMeshType = FullRect or Tight (based on rules)
spriteMode = Single or Multiple (based on rules)
```

## Use Cases

### Example 1: Basic Pixel Art Game
```
Include Paths: ["Assets/Sprites/"]
PPU: 32
Min Texture Size: 32
```

### Example 2: Mixed Asset Types
```
Include Paths: ["Assets/Art/Characters/", "Assets/Art/Environment/"]
Exclude Paths: ["Assets/Art/Environment/HD/"]
Full Rect Mesh Substrings: ["UI", "9Slice"]
Multiple Sprite Mode Substrings: ["Animation", "Spritesheet"]
```

## How It Works

The tool uses Unity's `AssetPostprocessor` to intercept texture imports. When a texture is imported:

1. Path is checked against include/exclude rules
2. If valid, optimal pixel art settings are applied
3. Sprite mesh type determined by naming/path rules
4. Sprite mode determined by naming/path rules
5. Texture size rounded to nearest power of two
6. Settings applied before import completes

**Result:** Zero manual configuration needed! ‚ú®

## Requirements

- Unity 2020.3 or higher
- No external dependencies

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Unity 2020.3 LTS+
- ‚úÖ All render pipelines (Built-in, URP, HDRP)
- ‚úÖ All platforms

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My sprites aren't being processed**  
A: Check that your sprite path is in `Include Paths` and not in `Exclude Paths`

**Q: Can I have multiple settings files?**  
A: Yes! Create multiple settings configurations. Only one can be active at a time.

**Q: How do I switch between different settings?**  
A: Select the settings you want to activate in the Inspector and click the "Set Active" button. The system automatically deactivates all other settings and activates the selected one.

**Q: How do I reset to defaults?**  
A: Delete the settings asset - it will be recreated with defaults on next import.

**Q: What if I delete default settings?**  
A: Simply restart Unity. Default settings will be automatically regenerated and set to active.

### Branch Naming Convention

We follow **semantic branch naming** with type prefixes:

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

**Types:**
- `feat/` - New features (e.g., `feat/add-animator-support`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/resolve-reentrancy-error`)
- `docs/` - Documentation changes (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/simplify-settings-loader`)
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

**Examples:**
```bash
git checkout -b feat/add-multiple-ppu-support
git checkout -b fix/path-matching-bug
git checkout -b docs/improve-installation-guide
```

### Commit Message Convention

We use **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Rules:**
- Summary line must be **50 characters or less**
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- No period at the end of the summary
- Body wraps at 72 characters (if needed)

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Tests
- `chore` - Maintenance

**Examples:**
```bash
# Good (under 50 chars)
git commit -m "feat: add sprite mesh configuration"
git commit -m "fix: resolve AssetDatabase reentrancy error"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"

# With scope
git commit -m "fix(loader): prevent nested refresh calls"
git commit -m "feat(settings): add multiple PPU support"

# With body
git commit -m "feat: add active settings management

- Implement SetActiveSettings method
- Add visual indicators in Inspector
- Auto-deactivate conflicting settings"
```
